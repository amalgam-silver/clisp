;;;; This a demo of database of cds
;;;; It's an example in chapter-3 of 'Pratical Common Lisp' written by Peter Seibel
;;;; Each record contains a title, an artist, a rate and a ripped flag
;;;; Following methods are supportted:
;;;; (add-cds): add records of cds, after finish inputing a record,
;;;;            user will be asked if another need to be input,
;;;;            end inputing by typing 'n'
;;;; (dump-cd db): output all the records in db
;;;; (save-db loaction): save all the records into a file
;;;; (load-db location): read records from a file
;;;; (select selector-fn): select records in *db* which match selector-fn
;;;; (update selector-fn &key title artist rating ripped): update records in *db* which match selector-fn
;;;; (delete-record selector-fn): delete records in *db* which match selector-fn
;;;; (where &key title artist rating ripped): generate a selector-fn
